# archon_auto_fisher
auto-fisher for archon mc server

WHAT SCRIPT DOES:
The script reels and then recasts whenever it sees that you caught a fish. It should catch the fish and then recast the rod back into water
and then continue waiting until you find a fish and then repeats.
*all you should have to do is cast rod first then it will automatically cast/recast for each catch.

HOW TO USE:
Scroll down a little and find the archon_auto_fisher.exe file and run it
It gives you 4 seconds to switch to minecraft and let it do its thing
YOU HAVE TO CAST ROD FIRST
*all the script does is reel whenever it sees that you caught a fish, so that explains why you have to cast first

KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:
-Reeling rod but not recasting(you would have to manually recast it) *pretty rare, problem if u are afk
-Reeling but not getting fish and not using bait *somewhat common, not a problem
-Captcha *i dont even know

THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:
-You have to be on mc for it to work(cant be on options screen or tabbed out)
-Have 35 bait so that it fills up all the slots in you inventory exactly
-Because of the bugs you cant fully afk. But this is not made to fully afk anyways its more so that you dont have to
focus on fishing when u are doing it. Like ill be watching youtube and check every 15 mins and itll be perfect time to
sell my inv.
